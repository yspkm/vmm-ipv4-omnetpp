This report investigates Vehicular Mobility Management (VMM) in IPv4 networks, focusing on handover mechanisms and RSSI data processing. Utilizing the OMNeT++ simulator with Simu5G and INET, we analyze handover strategies and the impact of RSSI data, enhanced by Kalman filtering. The study involves extracting and preprocessing RSSI data from simulations, then comparing handover and Ping Pong rates with and without Kalman filtering. The results, drawn from ten simulation runs, highlight the effectiveness of Kalman filtering in optimizing VMM handovers.
